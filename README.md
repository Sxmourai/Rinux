# Rinux

An experimental, small os using Linux code but translated in Rust

## Requirements

TODO Remove need for this (in rust-toolchain.toml it's possible)
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-none

## Sources

- Because this project uses limine, I use a simple library to parse the different data structures: [https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine-rs](Limine rs)
